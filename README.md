# qr-decomp
Finds the orthogonal basis of a vector space given a valid basis using the Gram-Schmidt process, done through recursively calculating projections. Also finds the QR decomposition of a matrix using the Gram-Schmidt process and multiplying by the transpose of the orthogonal matrix.
- 100% scalar multiplication and addition, 100% arrays and lists, 0% chance of finding someone who asked ðŸ¥²
